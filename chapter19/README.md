# Hadoop assignment 

You can run the work environment with [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)

thus if you have Vagrant and virtualbox installed:

`vagrant up`

The VM will download all the dependencies for hadoop, giving a working, though minimal, hadoop install
The resources will be available in the shared directory which is the checked-out git directory which is accessible in the VM under '/vagrant'
